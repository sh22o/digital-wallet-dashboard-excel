## 📌 Project Overview  
This is my **first interactive dashboard project**, created as a case study to practice **data analysis and visualization using Excel**.  
The project simulates a **digital wallet (fintech app)** environment where users perform transactions, earn cashback, and collect loyalty points.  

I built a **dynamic dashboard** with **PivotTables, PivotCharts, and KPI cards** to analyze:  
- Revenue performance  
- User behavior  
- Transaction reliability  
- Device and location trends

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used  
- **Excel** → Data Cleaning, PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers  
- **Data Analysis** → KPI definition, trend analysis, insights  
- **Dashboard Design** → Layout planning, interactivity, visualization  
- **Documentation & Storytelling** → Case study & slides  

**Duration:** 1 Week  
**Role:** Data Analyst – Dashboard Design & Insights Visualization

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains three main sections:  

1. **Transaction Details**  
   - Transaction_ID, Date, Status (Success, Failed, Pending)  
   - Merchant, Category, Amount  

2. **User Details**  
   - User_ID, Device Type (Android/iOS/Web)  
   - Location (Urban, Suburban, Rural)  

3. **Financial Details**  
   - Product Amount, Paid Amount, Transaction Fee  
   - Cashback, Loyalty Points  

**Cleaning Steps:**  
- Removed duplicates  
- Standardized category labels  
- Ensured date formats were consistent  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Build an **interactive dashboard in Excel** that:  
- Shows **business KPIs** (Revenue, Transactions, Cashback, Loyalty Points, ATV)  
- Analyzes **transaction status, payment methods, device usage**  
- Identifies **top-performing categories** and **user location distribution**  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features  

### 🔑 KPI Cards  
- **Total Revenue** → `SUM(Paid Amount)`  
- **Total Transactions** → `COUNT(Transaction_ID)`  
- **Total Cashback** → `SUM(Cashback)`  
- **Total Loyalty Points** → `SUM(Loyalty_Points)`  
- **Average Transaction Value (ATV)** → `Revenue ÷ Transactions`  

### 📈 Charts & Visuals  
- **Transaction Status** → Success vs Failed vs Pending  
- **Payment Method** → Card, Wallet Balance, Cash  
- **Device Type** → Android, iOS, Web  
- **Top 10 Product Categories (by Revenue)**  
- **User Distribution by Location** → Urban, Suburban, Rural  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **System Stability** → 95% successful transactions (3% failed, 2% pending)  
- **Mobile-First Usage** → 61% via Android → focus optimization on Android  
- **Revenue Drivers** → Streaming Services, Water Bills, and Gas Bills dominate revenue  
- **Urban Dominance** → Most transactions from urban users → wallet adoption strongest in cities

## 💡 Reflection & Next Steps  
### Reflection  
This was my **first professional attempt** at building a financial transactions dashboard.  
I learned:  
- Cleaning and structuring financial data  
- Defining KPIs for fintech products  
- Designing dashboards that communicate **business insights** clearly  

### Next Steps  
- Add **time-based trends** (daily, monthly revenue & transactions)  
- Compare **cashback vs transaction fees** (cost vs earnings)  
- Analyze **user growth & activity over time**  
- Build the next version in **Power BI or Tableau** for more advanced interactivity
